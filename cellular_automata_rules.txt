definitions:
    adjacent cells:
        cells 'A' and 'B' are adjacent if:
            1) they are orthogonally or diagonally connected
            formally: cell [i, j] is connected with [i+x, j+y] where x and y are each in the values {-1, 0, 1}

    vicinity of a cell:
        the vicinity of a cell 'A' is defined as:
            the set of cells in the cube centered at 'A' and of size 5x5x5

    supporting cells:
        cell 'A' supports cell 'B' if:
            1) cell 'A' is a solid block
            2) cell 'A' is supported by a cell other than cell B, or by any structure supported by B (i.e.: 'A' not a node in the tree rooted at 'B')
            3) cell 'A' is adjacent to cell 'B'
FIRE:
    If a cell 'A' is on fire:
        if there are less than 4 cells on fire in the vicinity of 'A': 40% chance of the fire is out on next step
        if no flammable block is in the vicinity of 'A', the fire is out on next step
    if a cell 'A' is not on fire and is adjacent to a flammable block:
        for each cell on fire in the vicinity of 'A', there is an extra 5% chance of 'A' catching fire next step
